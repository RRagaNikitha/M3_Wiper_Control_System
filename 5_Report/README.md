## INTRODUCTION:
A windscreen wiper, windshield wiper or wiper blade is a device used to remove rain, snow, ice, washer fluid, water, and/or debris from a vehicle's front window.
Practically all motorized vehicles, including planes, trains, boats and cars, feature windshield wipers.
* Wiper control system- A wiper control system for an automotive wiper controls the operational speed of a wiper in accordance with rain conditions. The control system includes a rain sensor detecting rain conditions.

## RESEARCH:
The design and developement of this project is done with the help of research papers and youtube videos.

## 4’Ws and 1’H:
* What: Wiper Control System
* Where: Used in all motorized vehicles
* When: Used to remove water, rain, snow or debris from a vehicle's front window
* Who- People driving the motorized vehicles
* How: The placement of wiper is based on the LED and and it returns to its normal position after cleaning the windscreen of the motor 

## SWOT ANALYSIS:
* Strengths- Removes debris from a vehicle's front window for a clear vision
* Weaknesses- Windshield washer nozzle can be clogged,  wipers can frozen or snowed on to the windshield, etc
* Opportunities- Can be used for security purposes during driving
* Threats- Newer technologies can always become a cause of threat

## HIGH LEVEL REQUIREMENT:
* ARM BASED MICROCONTROLLER -	STM32F407VGT6 BOARD
* PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE -	Embedded C
* OS- Windows
* HARD DRIVE- Upto 20 GB

## LOW LEVEL REQUIREMENT:
* Proper connection of pins 
* LED to control the wiper position
* Switch mechanism for activation and deactivation of wiper blades
